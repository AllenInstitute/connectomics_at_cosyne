    "text": "Connectomes are here! For the first time since the Mind of the Worm, we can gain insight into connectivity at synaptic level resolution across new species. In Drosophila, complete connectomes are already a reality, capturing the structure and connectivity of neurons throughout the central nervous system and for multiple individuals and both sexes. In addition, these resources integrate with morphology, gene expression and genetic tools, offering a powerful platform for the neuroscience community. In mammals, a complete connectome remains aspirational, but, recent advances have produced synapse-level reconstructions of neurons and circuits at an unprecedented scale, particularly within local cortical circuits.\nWe have entered a period of great innovation around how these detailed snapshots of the brain can inspire and constrain models of the nervous system when combined with experiments, theory, and computational methods. Vast opportunities remain to explore neuronal circuits, cell type diversity, glial interactions, neurovascular dynamics, subcellular networks, and more. However, technical barriers also remain present, including how to share, represent and curate complex datasets, how to work with data at various states of proofreading, and how to consider the variability and alignment of neurons and circuits across individuals, data modalities, and genetic tools.\nThis two-day workshop is designed to bring together systems and computational neuroscientists with the scientists who generate and curate connectomic datasets, to discuss current and future uses of these rich datasets for both hypothesis-driven and discovery-based research.\n\n\nMonday March 16\nThe rapid emergence of large-scale, synapse-resolution connectomes is transforming neuroscience by providing access to complete maps of neural circuitry across species. Yet, the field is still grappling with how to interpret these wiring diagrams in ways that connect structure to computation and behavior.\nThis workshop will bring together researchers working on flies, songbirds, mice, and other systems to explore what comparative connectomics can reveal about conserved motifs, species-specific specializations, and general principles of neural wiring. We will discuss how to integrate insights across scales—from synaptic connectivity and local circuit motifs to brain-wide organization—and how novel computational and theoretical frameworks can bridge gaps between anatomy and function. The workshop is designed for participants interested in connectomics, behavior, and computational neuroscience, and especially for those seeking to bridge experimental and theoretical approaches\n(to populate schedule)\n\n\n\nTuesday March 17\nThe second day of the workshop is action-focused:\n\nPresenters will share a diversity of research successes, strategies, and lessons learned—including in navigating the challenges posed by incomplete mammalian datasets and the impact of complete connectomes on studying neural systems.\nWe will empower the broader Cosyne community to engage with these powerful datasets, by providing examples of data access, analysis, and modeling related to the presented research.\nFoster dialogue between those generating and sharing the data and those using it, ensuring that access, usability, and communication is optimized for scientific impact.\n\nThis workshop will include research talks and some tutorials related to the presented research.\n\nCommon columns\n\n\nTime\nSpeaker\nTitle\n\n\n\n\n9:00-9:10\nJulijana Gjorgieva\nIntroduction\n\n\n9:10-9:35\nSrinivas Turanga\nTalk Title\n\n\n9:35-10:00\nSven Dorkenwald\nTalk Title\n\n\n10:00-10:25\nJakob Troidl\nTalk Title\n\n\n10:25-10:35\nBreak\nBreak\n\n\n10:35-11:00\nJan-Erik Hühne\nTalk Title\n\n\n11:00-11:25\nCasey Schneider-Mizell\nTalk Title\n\n\n11:30-12:30\nBethanny Danskin\nData Access Tutorial\n\n\n12:30-15:00\nBreak\nBreak\n\n\n15:00-15:25\nIla Fiete\nTalk Title\n\n\n15:25-15:50\nChangjoo Park\nTalk Title\n\n\n15:50-16:15\nSusanne Schreiber\nTalk Title\n\n\n16:15-16:25\nBreak\nBreak\n\n\n16:25-16:50\nSarah Pugliese\nTalk Title\n\n\n16:50-17:15\nMarcella Noorman\nTalk Title\n\n\n17:15-17:40\nAlessandro Sanzeni\nTalk Title\n\n\n17:40-18:00\nNuno Maçarico da Costa\nClosing remarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid (Dudi) Deutsch\nMichael Winding\nJulijana Gjorgieva\nNuno Maçarico da Costa\nBethanny Danskin\nJan-Erik Hühne"
